# CSS syntax
The syntax for CSS elements has the following patter:
Selector{Property:Value; Property:Value; ...}

Selector: Points to the HTML element to style
The Property:Value pair is called a declaration. Declarations must be separated from each other using a semicolon. Declarations are surrounded by curly braces.
