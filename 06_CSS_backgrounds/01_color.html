        <h1> Colors of the Colombian flag </h1>
        <p>
            This page shows the changes in background color for the body, h1, p and div elements.
        </p>
        <div>
            <h2> This h2 title is within a div element. </h2>
            <p>
                This paragraph is within the same div element as the title above.
                It kind of ruins the Colombian flag because the paragraph element has blue as the associated background color.
