        <h1> Plata is the cutest dog ever </h1>
        <p>
            The background of this page shows a photo of Plata, when it was a puppy.
            We all miss Plata very much :(
        </p>
        <p>
            Text has a white background because it was very hard to read otherwise.
            Because of image size the image of Plata is repeated through the background.
