# CSS Margins
Margin properties are used to create space around elements.
Margins can be set for each side of an element either insividually or in group.
Examples for the following are presented here:
1. Individual sides,
2. Shorthand property,
3. Auto value, and
4. Inherit value.
## Margin collapse
Is important to know that top and bottom margins collapse into each other. So when two consecutive elements have margins, the margin between the both is the largest among bottom (for the element on top) and top (for the element on bottom).
